  <h3>The classic dish, renowned worldwide</h3>
  <p>This is the type of pasta dinner recipe you can easily have at the ready thanks to a simply stocked pantry. This dish is both Italian in its inspiration and American in its popularity. It doesn’t call for anything extraordinary. In fact, it’s totally basic, and that’s what makes it all the better.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ground beef</li>
        <li>Tomato sauce</li>
        <li>Diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>Tomato paste</li>
        <li>Beef broth</li>
        <li>Canned mushrooms</li>
        <li>A splash of wine</li>
        <li>Onion, celery, and fresh garlic</li>
        <li>Dried whole cloves</li>
        <li>Dried herbs, kosher salt, freshly ground pepper, and a pinch of sugar</li>
    </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Brown the beef. Drain off any excess fat, then, throw in the chopped celery, onion, and garlic and cook until the vegetables soften.</li>
        <li>Boil and simmer. Dump the rest of the homemade pasta sauce ingredients into the pot and bring the mixture to a boil. Once the spaghetti sauce is boiling, reduce the heat and let it simmer on the stove for 3 hours. I know 3 hours sounds like forever, but that’s how long it takes to make a rich, flavorful meat sauce.</li>
        <li>Cook your noodles. Once the homemade spaghetti sauce has had time to simmer, all that’s left to do is boiling the spaghetti noodles according to package instructions and dish it up!</li>
    </ol>
