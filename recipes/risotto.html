  <h3>A creamy, traditional Italian rice dish</h3>
  <p>Risotto is a traditional Italian rice dish made from a short-grained, starchy variety of rice called Arborio rice. A properly cooked risotto should form a soft, creamy mound on a dinner plate—it shouldn't run across the plate, nor should it be stiff or gluey. While not difficult, some essential tips will help you make restaurant-worthy risotto at home.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups chicken stock</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
        <li>1 medium shallot, chopped</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups Arborio rice</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dry vermouth</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Italian parsley, chopped</li>
        <li>Kosher salt, to taste</li>
        <li>Fresher ground black pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>In a medium saucepan, heat the stock to a simmer. Lower the heat so the stock stays hot while you cook the risotto.</li>
        <li>In a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan, heat the oil and 1 tablespoon of the butter over medium heat. When the butter has melted, add the chopped shallot or onion. Sauté for 2 to 3 minutes or until slightly translucent.</li>
        <li>Add the rice to the pot and stir it briskly with a wooden spoon so that the grains are coated with the oil and melted butter. Sauté for another minute or so, until there is a slightly nutty aroma. Make sure not to let the rice turn brown.</li>
        <li>Add the vermouth or wine and cook while stirring, until the liquid is fully absorbed.</li>
        <li>Add a ladle of hot chicken stock to the rice and stir every once in a while until the liquid is fully absorbed. When the rice appears almost dry, add another ladle of stock and repeat the process.</li>
        <li>Continue adding stock, a ladle at a time, for about 20 minutes or until the grains are tender but still firm to the bite, without being crunchy (al dente).</li>
        <li>Stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter and the Parmesan cheese and parsley. Season to taste with kosher salt and freshly ground pepper.</li>
        <li>Serve in bowls and enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
