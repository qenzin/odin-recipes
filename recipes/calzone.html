  <h3>An oven-baked, folded pizza that has sealed edges so all the good stuff stays in!</h3>
  <p>Anything that goes on a pizza can go into a calzone! The pizza fillings are placed on one half of the circular shaped pizza dough. The dough is then folded over, crimped, coated with an egg wash or a brush of olive oil and baked in the oven.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 pound pizza dough</li>
    <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce</li>
    <li>1/2 cup yellow onion (diced)</li>
    <li>1/2 cup green bell pepper (diced)</li>
    <li>1/2 cup sliced pepperoni</li>
    <li>1 cup mozzarella cheese (shredded)</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 425Â°F and line a large sheet pan with parchment paper.</li>
    <li>Divide pizza dough into 4 equal parts and roll each dough ball into a 1/4 inch thick circle.</li>
    <li>On half of each dough circle, add equal parts sauce, yellow onion, green bell pepper, and sliced pepperoni. Make sure to leave a little room around the edges so you can crimp the calzone shut.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle the toppings with equal parts shredded cheese. Then fold the other half of the dough over the toppings and crimp the edges.</li>
    <li>Cut 2-3 air vents into the top of the calzone and place it on to the prepared baking sheet.</li>
    <li>Brush with olive oil and bake for about 15 minutes or until the dough is fully cooked and the calzone is golden brown.</li>
    <li>Serve with warmed pizza sauce for dipping.</li>
  </ol>
