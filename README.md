Hello! Thank you for viewing my first project while en route to completing The Odin Project! My goal was to create a site for recipes using HTML. I decided to theme my recipes around Italian food. 

After completing the project, I have developed several skills. To start, I have continued to practice adding and committing files to Git and Github. This concept was definitely strange when beginning, but it's becoming more familiar. On top of this, I have practiced executing basic tags and elements in HTML. These include the boilerplate, links, images, lists, headings, titles, paragraphs, and tools for text emphasis.

The project was rewarding, and I feel a sense of accomplishment having completed a somewhat structured website.
